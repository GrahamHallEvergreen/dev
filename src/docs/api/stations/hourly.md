# Hourly Data

This endpoint provides historical hourly observations for a particular weather station. Furthermore, gaps in the time series can be filled in with statistically optimized model data. The data provided through this endpoint is aggregated from multiple governmental interfaces.

Hourly observations are coming in with an offset of about two to three hours. However, some data might be added multiple days or even months later, depending on how the different weather services are updating their datasets.

Hourly data can be queried for a **maximum of 10 days** per request.

## Endpoint

Hourly data is provided through this endpoint:

```
GET https://api.meteostat.net/v2/stations/hourly

## Parameters

When calling this endpoint please refer to the following parameters.

## Example

The following example requires the cURL command-line interface. Alternatively, you can use an API client like Postman.

```sh
curl --header "x-api-key: {key}" "https://api.meteostat.net/v2/stations/hourly?station=10637&start=2020-02-01&end=2020-02-04"
```

Please replace `{key}` with your personal API key.
