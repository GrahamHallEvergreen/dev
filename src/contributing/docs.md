# Documentation

Keeping our documentation up-to-date is crucial. If you are contributing to parts of our ecosystem, please make sure to add corresponding documentation. Also, if anything appears to be unclear or misleading in one of our articles, feel free to propose changes.

## Deployment

The Meteostat team will review all pull requests. Once a PR has been approved and merged into the `master` branch, Meteostat will automatically deploy changes into the productive environment.
