# Documentation

Keeping our documentation up-to-date is crucial. If you are contributing to parts of our ecosystem, please make sure to add corresponding documentation. Also, if anything appears to be unclear or misleading in one of our articles, feel free to propose changes.

## Deployment

At the moment, we don't deploy changes automatically. Team members of Meteostat with necessary permissions can deploy documentation updates to our GitHub Pages repository. From the root directory of the _dev_ repository, run:

```sh
sh deploy.sh
```
