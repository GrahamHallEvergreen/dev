# Weather Stations

A weather station is a location where meteorological data is measured. Most weather stations available via the Meteostat API are operated by governmental organizations like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Many of these organizations provide public access to the gathered information. Meteostat uses multiple open data interfaces to collect as much weather and climate data as possible.

Nowadays, most stations run fully automized. However, in contrast to computed model data environmental or technical issues can cause gaps in the data series when relying on observations reported by weather stations. Furthermore, some weather stations may only report a small set of meteorological parameters. Please be aware that some data output might be incomplete.
