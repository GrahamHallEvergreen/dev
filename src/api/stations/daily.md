# Daily Data

This endpoint provides historical daily statistics for a particular weather station. The data provided through this endpoint is aggregated from multiple governmental interfaces.

Daily data is coming in with an offset of about one to seven days. However, some data might be added multiple days or even months later, depending on how the different weather services are updating their datasets. Additionally, Meteostat provides daily aggregates based on hourly observations.

Daily data can be queried for a **maximum of 370 days** per request.

## Example

The following example requires the cURL command-line interface. Alternatively, you can use an API client like Postman.

```

Please replace `{key}` with your personal API key.
