# Daily Data

This endpoint provides one GZ compressed CSV file per weather station.

## Endpoints

Full data dumps, including model data as substitute, are available here:

```
https://bulk.meteostat.net/v2/daily/full/{station}.csv.gz
```

If you only want real observation data, please use the following endpoint instead:

```
https://bulk.meteostat.net/v2/daily/obs/{station}.csv.gz
```

Please replace `{station}` with the ID of a weather station.

Weather stations are identified using their Meteostat ID, which equals the WMO ID for weather stations which are part of the WMO index.

## Structure

CSV files provided through the Meteostat bulk data interface use commas as separators. Each file provides the following columns:
